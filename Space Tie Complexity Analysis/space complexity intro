space complexity is the maximum auxillary or extra space for solving a problem
Bubble sort is implace algo as it does not need any extra space for holding data
it take O(1) space as it need constant number of variables to solve the problem

Fibonacci series:- 
by takeing two variables then it take o(1) space and o(N) time
when done by recursion then it takes O(N) spce and O(2^n) time

for Merge Sort:-
time O(NlogN)
space O(n)


merge Sort
time O(nlog n)

in worst case like array 0f 1,2,3,4,5 pivot elmt 5 will not move will be at last so time will be O(n*n), to overcome this we have randomise 
quicksort in which we shuffle the elemnt

space is O(logN)
