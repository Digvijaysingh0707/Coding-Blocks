Tim &space  coplexity is O(n) as we are traversing everyelement once
Prepare alist of ancestors of p 

Prepare alist of ancestors of q
then find the common part for p and q
as we are moving from top to bottom the last element of commmon part will be the lca

Assumption both a and b are present in the tree
