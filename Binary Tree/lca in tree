Tim &space  coplexity is O(n) as we are traversing everyelement once
Prepare alist of ancestors of p 

Prepare alist of ancestors of q
then find the common part for p and q
as we are moving from top to bottom the last element of commmon part will be the lca

Assumption both a and b are present in the tree

static TreeNode lca(TreeNode root,int a,int b){
        if (root==null)return null;
        if (root.val==a||root.val==b)return root;
        TreeNode left=lca(root.left,a,b);
        TreeNode right=lca(root.right,a,b);
        if (left!=null&&right!=null)return root;
        if (left!=null)return left;
        else return right;
    }
