[Preorder,inorder,postorder] are depth first search
Level order traversal is breadth first search

Approach 1 :- it can be done using level order traversal in which we write all elements presents in a particular level(from left to right)
then the element at the end will be the element seen from the right view and the first elemnt is the elemnt seen from the left view. this 
approach is not implememted
 we have used depth search approach in which root will always be  the answer and we first visit the right subtree



        
      static void rightView(TreeNode root,int level,int max){
        if (root==null)return;
        if (max<level){
            System.out.println(root.val);
            max=level;
        }
        rightView(root.right,level+1,max);
        rightView(root.left,level+1,max);
    }
