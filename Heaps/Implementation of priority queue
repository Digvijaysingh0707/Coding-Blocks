Can beimplementated as:
1 Unsortec array:- insert O(1),deletion O(n),get O(n)
2 sorted array :- insert O(n),deletion O(n),get O(n)
3 unsorted arry:- insert O(1),deletion O(n),get O(n)
4 sorted list:- insert O(n),deletion O(1)( for specific position O(n)),get O(n)
5 BST:- insert O(h),deletion O(h),get O(h) for balanced bst h==logn bse 2

6 Binary heap:- it is complete bt ,every child has priority lesser than parent
insert O(log n),deletion O(log n),get O(1)


Tpes of heaps:
min heap=value of parent <value of child
max heap=value of parent >value of child

Reprsentation ofheaps: it is generally representated as linear ds as array because accessing of child to parrent or vice versa is true


parent is at i then left child at 2*i+1, right child at 2*i+2
value of child is given at j the parent will be at floor value of (j-1)/2

when indexing startts from 1 then
parent is at i then left child at 2*i, right child at 2*i+1
value of child is given at j the parent will be at floor value of (j)/2
